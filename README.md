# Create an Interactive Web Map with GeoJSON

This lab will guide you through the process of building GeoJSON data, and mapping it in Leaflet.js . In particular we will learn how to hard code GeoJSON data into our Leaflet maps, style these GeoJSON layers, attach pop ups to features, and add hovering mouse events.
